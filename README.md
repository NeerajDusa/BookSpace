# BookSpace
A Free Book's Website 

The main motivation of the project is to help the poor by giving books for free. In these present situations, it is difficult for poor people 👨‍👩‍👧 to even afford food 🥗, thus affording money 💰 for buying books 📖 has become a big burden for their child's education 🧑‍🎓!!

➤ This website will play a major role in giving books 📚 to the poor for free which will be very helpful for them 🙇‍♂️. 

➤ The donors 👨‍💻 will have to donate their old books to our website and we collect them and add them to our website 💻.

➤ The users 👩🏻‍💻 can come to our website and get the books free of cost 🆓 from our website.
 
Please refer the above ☝️ attached Documentation 📑 for setup and more information.
